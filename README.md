# Metaheuristics for the Liner shipping single service design problem with arrival time service levels

This repository contains the Python code for the implementations of algorithms introduced in my master's thesis.

Examples of how the code can be used are given in `example.ipynb`.

The contents of the folders "instances" and "stochastic_data" are taken directly and unedited from https://bitbucket.org/dotbielefeld/lsssd_instances/src/master/.
More information on the data is given there.
